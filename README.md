### Fixed Bugs

#### Fixed Timer Display Issue
- Previously, the quiz timer was not updating in real-time, leading to inaccurate time tracking during the quiz. Users couldn't rely on the displayed timer to gauge how much time they had spent.
- To resolve this, the JavaScript code responsible for updating the timer was revised. Now, the timer accurately reflects the elapsed time from the start of the quiz. The setInterval function is utilized to consistently update the timer display, providing users with an authentic representation of their quiz duration.

#### Resolved Incorrect Scoring:
- Users reported instances where their correct answers were not consistently contributing to their final quiz score. This inconsistency raised concerns about the accuracy of the quiz scoring system.
- A comprehensive examination of the scoring logic was undertaken. It was discovered that a conditional statement was not effectively capturing and tallying all correct responses. The logic was revised to ensure that each correct answer consistently adds to the user's score. This adjustment guarantees a reliable and accurate reflection of the user's knowledge in the final quiz score.
